Notes I made while trying to get the slideshow to display.

Changes:
- v3d replace
- custom resolution
- group=2
- mode=87

Still wrong resolution

- force_hotplug

Black screen...

- disable_overscan=1

Same again

- revert last 2, and apt upgrade

Back to displaying, but at wrong resolution
BUT BUT BUT I noticed that if I run feh from the terminal, it does the right thing

- add in a 10s sleep

Still broken
